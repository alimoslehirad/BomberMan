## Installation
Litho can be integrated either in Gradle or Buck projects. Read our [Getting Started](http://fblitho.com/docs/getting-started) guide for installation instructions.

## Quick start
### 1. Initialize `SoLoader` in your `Application` class.
```java
public class SampleApplication extends Application {
  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    SoLoader.init(this, false);
  }
}
```
### 2. Create and display a component in your Activity
```java
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    final ComponentContext context = new ComponentContext(this);

    final Component component = Text.create(context)
        .text("Hello World")
        .textSizeDip(50)
        .build();

    setContentView(LithoView.create(context, component));
}
```
